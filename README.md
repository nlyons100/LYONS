## About me
I have extensive experience in driving strategic projects through planning and execution and setting clear metrics of impact and providing data-driven solutions. I am highly committed to expanding my strong foundations in data science; I am currently completing a Data Science (Foundations) Bootcamp with HyperionDev, where I am building experience in Python programming, data analytics and visualisations and Machine Learning.  

With a completed Master’s degree in molecular biology, I have experience working to high standards of data quality and creating and maintaining data pipelines. I have experience in working with a variety of databases and am proficient in using spreadsheets to track and deliver data insights. 

### Key work experience 

I have led large-scale project management for the UK’s leading charities developing scaled programmes in public health, driving end-to-end project delivery on tight timelines. I’ve recently transitioned to the technology sector, developing strong foundations in data externalisation and developing training programmes for academic researchers. These endeavours have further developed my strong project management skills, having gained valuable experience in scoping, proposal development, project planning and risk management. These experiences have also strengthened my ability to work with a variety of project stakeholders, including senior management in research institutes in both the UK and abroad. I take a strategic and analytical approach to challenges that arise during project delivery and take pride in my ability to creatively adapt to achieve effective resolutions.   

I previously managed an international collaboration at the prestigious Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. This position offered immense opportunities for professional growth, as I simultaneously conducted an independent research project in addition to managing a collaboration between six research groups across Canada and Japan. During my time at the Hospital for Sick Children, I developed and supported strong, positive collaborative relationships, organised national and international meetings and was committed to effectively communicating personal research findings. The varied nature of this role demanded that I thoughtfully managed my time and priorities to deliver successful projects. Additionally, I have previous experience working at a Canadian academic institution within a multi-disciplinary team of lawyers and commercialisation experts primarily involving research monitoring and evaluation.
